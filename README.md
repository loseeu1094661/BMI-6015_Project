# BMI-6015_Project
Daxton/Nathan ML Project

Project tasks division:
(15 points): Prepare the data, including feature vectorization, handling missing data, and addressing imbalances.
Nathan

(10 points): Explore the data using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data and explore correlations between its features.
Daxton


Model Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate supervised/unsupervised models using SciKit Learn or PyTorch (for neural networks). Aim for an end-to-end implementation with pipelines that encompass all steps from input to output.


(20 points): Use 3+ supervised ML models covered in class.
Daxton (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM)

(15 points): Use 3+ unsupervised ML models covered in class.
Nathan (PCA, K-means, anomaly deetection)

(5 points): Implement validation techniques like K-fold cross-validation.
Daxton (Class example using k-nearest neighbors (Supervised Learning))

(10 points): Use Optuna to tune hyperparameters and document the best values.
Both? Will see what this is

(5 points): Evaluate and report on the results of the best models.
Daxton

(5 points): Organize steps using pipelines.
Both will implement within the models

(10 points): Use SHAP to explain and interpret the obtained results.
Both? Will see what this is

(5 points): Ensure that your implementation notebook(s) is well-organized and easy to follow. Points will be deducted for messy or unclear code.
